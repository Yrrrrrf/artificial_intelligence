# [Multiagent Systems](./reports/multiagent_systems.ipynb)

Is a subfield of [artificial intelligence](./artificial_intelligence.md) that studies **distributed autonomous agents** that interact with each other to achieve a common goal. The agents can be **human** or **software**. The study of multiagent systems provides methodologies, formalisms, and tools to analyze complex systems that are composed of interacting autonomous agents.
