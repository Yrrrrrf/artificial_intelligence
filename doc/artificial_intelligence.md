# Artificial Intelligence

Is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications of AI include **expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision**. I uses [data science](../data%20science.md) to train the AI model that can solve a determinated problem.
